**Bug Documentation: Spice Server Contact Issue with Looking Glass on Windows 10/11**

---
#KVM 
**Description:**
When using Looking Glass with Windows 10 or 11, users may encounter a bug where the Spice server fails to establish proper contact if no physical monitor is connected to the system. This documentation provides steps to resolve this issue by installing a virtual display driver and configuring monitor options.

---

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Download the Virtual Display Driver:**

	- Download the virtual display driver from [this repository](https://github.com/ge9/IddSampleDriver).
	- Alternatively, directly download the driver from [this link](https://github.com/ge9/IddSampleDriver/releases/tag/0.0.1.2).
	  
	  2. **Driver Installation:**
	- Extract the downloaded driver archive to the root of the Windows system disk (typically `C:\`).
	- Navigate to the extracted folder (`C:\IddSampleDriver`).
	  
	  3. **Create Configuration File:**
	- Within the `C:\IddSampleDriver` folder, create a new text file named `options.txt`.
	  
	  4. **Configure Options:**
	- Open the `options.txt` file and add the following lines:
	  
	  ```plaintext
	  1
	  1n
	  # place this file in "C:\IddSampleDriver\"
	  # lines beginning with "#" are ignored (comment)
	  # the first line mush be a positive integer (small number (<5) is recommended)), NOT comment
	  # (currently) the location of this file must be "C:\IddSampleDriver\option.txt" (hard-coded)
	  # numbers should be separated by comma

	  This file should be created as `C:\IddSampleDriver\options.txt` with the provided content.
	  
	  Then run this in CMD
	  ```
	  cd C:\IddSampleDriver
	  CertMgr.exe /add C:\IddSampleDriver\IddSampleDriver.cer /s /r localMachine root
	  ```
	  If that CertMgr.exe does not exist download the windows 10 sdk download page.

	  5. **Install the Virtual Display Driver:**
	- Open Device Manager.
	- Click on any device and then click on "Action" in the top panel.
	- Select "Add legacy hardware" from the dropdown.
	- Click "Next" and choose "Install hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)".
	- Proceed by clicking "Next" while ensuring "Show all devices" is selected.
	- Choose "Have disk" and then "Browse".
	- Locate and select the `C:\IddSampleDriver\IddSampleDriver.inf` file, then click "OK".
	- Continue with "Next" and then "Next" to complete the installation.
	  
	  6. **Monitor Installation Confirmation (Windows 11):**
	- After successful installation, on Windows 11, an animation should indicate the monitor installation.
	  
	  7. **Configuration:**
	- Once the driver is installed, configure your virtual monitor settings as desired by editing `C:\IddSampleDriver\option.txt`.
	  
	  8. **Disconnect Physical Monitor:**
	- Once the virtual display driver is installed and configured, you can disconnect the physical monitor.
	  
	  9. **Set Virtual Monitor Resolution:**
	- Use Looking Glass to set the resolution of the virtual display as needed.
	  
	  10. **Set Mouse Settings:**
	- To fix the annoying mouse leaving the screen we have to disable mouse acceleration.
	- Navigate to Start > Settings > Devices > Mouse. Choose Additional mouse options > Pointer Options > and uncheck Enhance pointer precision.
