- Certainly! Here's your documentation with a few improvements for clarity and readability:

  **Listing All Interfaces:**
  
  To view all interfaces, ensure you are in the enable terminal, then use the coommand:
  
  ```
  show ip interfaces brief
  ```

  **Configuring Trunk Ports on Cisco:**
  
  Trunk ports are crucial for connecting access points (APs), or routers to switches. Follow these steps to configure a trunk port:
  
  ```
  enable
  configure terminal
  interface gigabitethernet0/0
  switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
  switchport mode trunk
  no shutdown
  ```

  **Configuring a Single Interface with a Specific VLAN:**
  
  If you need to configure a single interface with a specific VLAN, execute the following commands:
  
  ```
  enable
  configure terminal
  interface gigabitethernet0/1
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10
  no shutdown
  ```

  **Configuring Multiple Interfaces Simultaneously:**
  
  To configure multiple interfaces simultaneously, follow these steps:
  
  1. First, check the list of available interfaces using:
  
  ```
  show ip interface brief
  ```
  
  You'll see a list similar to this:
  
  ```
  gigabitethernet0/0
  gigabitethernet0/1
  ...
  ```
  
  The `0/x`, `1/x`, `2/x`, `3/x` indicates the module where the interface is located.
  
  2. To configure a range of interfaces, use the following command:
  
  ```
  interface range gigabitethernet 0/0 - 3
  ```
  
  This configures interfaces `gigabitethernet0/0` to `gigabitethernet0/3`. However, trying to configure interfaces beyond `3` will result in an error.
  
  3. To configure interfaces across different modules, use commas to separate the ranges:
  
  ```
  interface range gigabitethernet 0/0 - 3, gigabitethernet 1/0 - 3, gigabitethernet 2/0 - 3, gigabitethernet 3/0 - 3
  ```
  
  This command configures interfaces from `gigabitethernet0/0` to `gigabitethernet3/3`.
  
  Ensure to issue `no shutdown` command after configuring to activate the interfaces.
