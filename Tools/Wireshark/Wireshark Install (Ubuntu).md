# Documentation: Installing and Launching Wireshark on Linux
- ## Introduction
  #networking 
  This guide provides instructions for installing Wireshark, a popular network protocol analyzer, on a Linux system. It also includes steps to automate the installation and launching process using keyboard shortcuts and command delays.
- ## Prerequisites
- A Linux-based operating system.
- Sudo privileges for the installing user.
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands.
- ## Steps for Installing and Launching Wireshark
- ### 1. Opening the Terminal
- Use the keyboard shortcut `CTRL-ALT-T` to open the terminal.
- ### 2. Installing Wireshark
- Enter the following command to install Wireshark:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install wireshark -y
  ```
- The `-y` flag automatically confirms the installation, eliminating the need for manual confirmation.
- ### 3. Automated Delay (Optional)
- If automating the process (e.g., through a script), introduce a delay to ensure that the installation completes before proceeding. This can be achieved by using a `DELAY` command (in milliseconds) if scripting:
  ```bash
  DELAY 10000  # Waits for 10 seconds
  ```
- ### 4. Launching Wireshark
- After installation, launch Wireshark with:
  ```bash
  sudo wireshark
  ```
- It's important to run Wireshark with `sudo` to ensure it has the necessary permissions for capturing network packets.
- ## Important Considerations
- **Security Warning**: Running Wireshark as `sudo` can pose security risks. It's recommended to configure non-root users to capture packets securely. This can typically be done during the installation process or by configuring group permissions afterward.
- **Graphical Environment**: Wireshark has a graphical user interface. Ensure that you're running it in a graphical environment, not a headless server.
- **First Launch**: On the first launch, Wireshark may ask to choose an interface to capture packets from. Select the appropriate network interface as needed.
- ## Conclusion
  Wireshark is a powerful tool for network analysis and troubleshooting. By following these steps, you can easily install and launch Wireshark on your Linux system. Regularly update your installation to receive the latest features and security patches. For more advanced configurations and usage, refer to the Wireshark documentation and community resources.
