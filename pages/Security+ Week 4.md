		- Common venerability scoring system
<<<<<<< HEAD
		- scores vulnerabilities based on severity
	- Vulnerability scanner
		- can scan apps web apps and others
		- firewalls switches
		- can tell you what you can do to fix somtimes
	- Exposure Factor
		- the percetage that the vulnerbility could fail the service
		- a DDoS could limit the service to 50%
		  a buffer overflow could crash the app and take it down 100%
	- Enviorment variables
		- how important is the device to the network
		- how many users rely on it is it part of the main network?
	- Risk tolernece
		- Low tolerence means it needs to be patched
		- high tolerance means meh we can patch other stuff
- # Video 4.3.5 Vulnerability Remediation
	- ### Insurance
		- offload risk to others
	- ### Ways you can segment a network
		- physical
		- logical w/ vlans
		- firewalls
	- ### compensating controles
		- when you cant deploy a patch
		- no internal firewalls
		- you can disable the service or limit external use, or modify the security controls and software firewalls to  block a port that the service uses
	- ### Exception or exemption
		- when a service can not be patched
		- you want to provide the service but also want to protect the data and systems
		- this will be determined by the severity of the exploit and how it can be exploited
			- for example a user may need to be local to exploit the service
	- ### Validation of remediation
		- make sure the patch did what it was supposed to do
		- preform a scan of the app to see the change
		- audits can be preformed to check that the patch actauly happened

		- Object identifiers
	- SNMP traps
		- SNMP data transfer requires a poll request
		- you can root out fake devices by sending i regular poll requests
		- communicates over 162/udp
		- if the CRC error increases by 5 send a trap
	- NetFlow
		- A standard for monitoring data on a network
		- ususaly included in hardware like switches or routers
