- # Cyber Patriot Structure Draft
  
  The purpose of this document is to describe a potential class outline for Cyber at the Wiesbaden High School. This potential class format will be a collaborative work between Mentors, students, and teachers at the Wiesbaden High School.
  
  To best prepare students for the IT workforce, a class format that closely resembles a Company. Freshmen interested in the Cyber/IT realm will enter the class as “Interns” with the understanding that they will primarily shadow more experienced members to learn the expectations and content of the work. Sophomores will be considered “Junior Engineers,” whether that takes the form of Junior project managers, junior network engineers, or another title that best suits the skills of the student. Sophomores could also choose a specific work role instead of being assigned to one particular group or another. Juniors would be considered full Engineers, working with the sophomores and freshmen to bring them up to speed on cyber/IT work. Juniors will also work with seniors to keep both the Infrastructure of the network and the administrative tasks necessary for managing the network. Seniors will be considered “SME’s” or subject matter experts. The SME’s will have a holistic view of the network, keeping an eye on what should be Life cycle replaced, policy changes, security updates, etc. The SME’s will also be responsible for working with the Engineers on setting up Fundraisers (If necessary) or reaching out to community members/sponsors to provide network requirements to the STEM Lab.
- ## As a Summary:
- ### “Interns”
  Layer 1 and 2, focusing primarily on Infrastructure services and physical connectivity. Shadowing Junior and Senior Engineers to get a grasp of the work and an understanding of the responsibilities involved.
- ### “Junior Engineers”
  Layer 2 and 3, focusing primarily on Logical network connectivity while also having a good grasp of the physical connectivity. Works with Interns and Senior Engineers to ensure physical and logical network connectivity of the STEM Lab.
- ### “Senior Engineers”
  Layer 3 plus administrative management, focusing primarily on SysAdmin level work, ensuring Policy and Policy groups for “Employees” meet Cyber/IT Standards. Senior Engineers will also be touching on layer 4 technologies for Securing the network as well as firewall technologies. Senior Engineers work with SME’s to manage the network as a whole, taking direction from the SME’s so that the network can meet Standards and stay up to date.
- ### “SME’s”
  SME’s will have a good understanding of Layers 1 – 4, which will enable them to engineer and design an overarching network architecture as updates and Cutovers are required. During “company downtime,” SME’s will work on high-level admin tasks such as Fundraisers, reaching out to community members/sponsors who may be interested in the program, and working with mentors to facilitate training for “company members.”

- ## “Interns” Class Format:
  CompTIA A+ is a good blueprint for learning hardware, but not necessarily layer 1 connectivity for a network. Freshmen should focus on getting a good understanding of Hardware required for a Computer to work, while also learning how to crimp ethernet cable, and if possible fiber cable. Hands-on labs would work best for learning cabling, building a computer, and even installing a basic OS onto the computer.
  
  The hope is that Junior Engineers would be showing/teaching the Interns how to crimp ethernet cable, and if possible fiber, in addition to the basics of Computer hardware. This would be done during “Company downtime” as during “Work hours” the Interns would be shadowing both Junior and Senior Engineers.
  
  As of writing this outline, the CompTIA A+ exam is split into two Core Objectives, or two exams:
  
  **CORE 1:**
- Mobile Devices: 15%
- Networking: 20%
- Hardware: 25%
- Virtualization and Cloud Computing: 11%
- Hardware and Network troubleshooting: 29%
  
  **CORE 2:**
- Operating Systems: 31%
- Security: 25%
- Software Troubleshooting: 22%
- Operational Procedures: 22%
  
  CORE 1 focuses more on Hardware components, while CORE 2 focuses more on software components. The recommended approach would be to focus on CORE 1, then if time allows, work on CORE 2.

- ## “Junior Engineers”
  Given that the Junior Engineers have worked through the majority of CORE 1 and CORE 2 of the CompTIA A+, Junior Engineers will begin work on the switching concepts introduced in Cisco’s CCNA.
  
  The hope is that the Junior Engineers will work with the Senior engineers for clarification, and the interns to finalize foundational knowledge of the A+.
  
  As of writing this, Cisco CCNA is version CCNA 200-301 v1.
  
  **CCNA:**
- Network Fundamentals: 20%
- Network Access: 20%
- IP Services: 10%
  
  These domains from the CCNA will cover the majority of Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies. Basic layer 2 technologies include VLANs and the concepts of collision domains.
  
  ---
- ## “Lead Engineers”
  Given that the Lead Engineers have covered the majority of the A+ and the first half of CCNA, Lead Engineers will finish the remainder of the exam topics for CCNA.
  
  The hope is that the Lead Engineers will assist/work with both Interns and Junior Engineers to finalize foundational knowledge of A+ and CCNA.
  
  **CCNA:**
- IP Connectivity: 25%
- Security Fundamentals: 15%
- Automation and Programmability: 10%
  
  These domains cover higher-level IP concepts, Security implementation on the network, as well as WiFi and Automation on the network.
  
  ---
- ## “SME’s”
  SME’s will have covered all of the A+, most if not all of the first half of CCNA, and most of the second half of CCNA. The information earned from both exams will be paramount as they transition into more of a leadership role. The responsibilities of the SME’s are to keep the network up to date, communicate with school leadership regarding improvements to the network, seek sponsors, and work with mentors to train their peers.
  
  The hope is that the SME’s will enable the Cyber Patriot class to Life cycle replace currently used networking equipment via planned and approved cutovers, review and approve architecture designs. SME’s will also test architecture designs for security and usability before implementation into the production environment.
  
  While SME’s will have a high-level authority, the responsibilities they carry are also at a high level. Should any SME decide to abuse the authority trusted to them, they will be removed from the program.
