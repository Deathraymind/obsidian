### EAP #card
background-color:: yellow
	- Extensible authentication protocol
	- used in wireless networks, p2p
- ### PEAP #card
  background-color:: red
	- Protected Extensible authentication protocol
	- a version of EAP that creates a secure encrypted tunnel using TLS to
- ### LEAP #card
  background-color:: pink
	- Lightweight extensible authentication protocol
	- a cisco proprietary EAP method for wireless networks
- ### SEH #card
  background-color:: green
	- A low level mechinism in windows to hadle hardware and software exception
- ### EH #card
  background-color:: blue
	- A high level standardization exception handling in c++
- ### EXR #card
  background-color:: purple

- ### DAC #card
  background-color:: yellow
	- (Discretionary Access Control):**
	- Access is determined by the owner of the resource, who can grant permissions to others. This is not the primary mechanism used by SELinux.
- ### RBAC #card
  background-color:: red
	- (Role-Based Access Control):**
	- Access is based on the roles assigned to users. Although SELinux can incorporate aspects of role-based policies, its core mechanism is MAC.
- ### MAC #card
  background-color:: pink
	- (Mandatory Access Control):
	- SELinux enforces security policies that dictate how processes and users can access system resources, regardless of the userâ€™s discretion. This is the primary security mechanism imposed by SELinux.
- ### ABAC #card
  background-color:: green
	- (Attribute-Based Access Control):**
	- Access decisions are based on attributes (such as user attributes, resource attributes, etc.). This is not the mechanism used by SELinux.
- ### SRTP #card
  background-color:: green
	- **SRTP** is specifically designed to provide encryption, authentication, and integrity for real-time multimedia communications, such as audio and video streams over IP networks. It is an extension of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) that secures the data being transmitted.
