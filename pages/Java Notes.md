- Function #java
	- a block of code that completes a goal
		- First specify the return type of the function this is often void
		- inside of the perenthsies of void nameoffuntion() goes the parameters
		- the main function needs to exist so it gets called
- class
	- is a container for related functions
	- in java we define a class with class and closed  squiggly parentheses
	- when a function is out of class its refereed to as a function but when its in a class its refereed to as a method.
	- all classes sould have a acsess modifier
		- is a special keyword if other classes can call these methods
		- public private ect
- This is a basic structure of a java program
  ```public class Main {
  public class Main {
  	public void main() {
      
      ...
      
  	}
  }
  ```
- Methods should use the PascalNamingConvention while methods should use the camelNamingConventions.
- Packages contain groups of classes
