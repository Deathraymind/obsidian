# Add Plex APT Repository and Import GPG Key

Execute the following commands to add the Plex APT repository to your system and import the repository's GPG key:

```bash
curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list
```

# Update Package List and Install Plex Media Server

Update your package list and install the latest version of the Plex Media Server:

```sql
sudo apt update
sudo apt install plexmediaserver
```

# Verify Plex Service Status

To confirm that Plex is running, check the service status with:

```lua
sudo systemctl status plexmediaserver
```

You should see an output indicating that the Plex Media Server is active and running.

# Configure Plex Media Server

Create directories to store Plex media files:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/plexmedia/{movies,series}
```

Set the correct ownership for these directories. The Plex Media Server runs as the user 'plex', which requires read and execute permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R plex: /opt/plexmedia
```

Note: You can choose any location to store media files, but ensure to set the correct permissions.

# Access Plex Server Configuration

To proceed with server configuration, open your web browser and navigate to:

```arduino
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:32400/web
```

This address will redirect you to the Plex website for further configuration.





# File Browser Docker Setup Guide

File Browser provides a convenient way to manage files and directories through a web interface. This guide covers setting up File Browser in a Docker container on a Linux-based system.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands.

## Installation Steps

1. **Create Required Directory and Files**

   Set up the directory and necessary files for File Browser:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /home/filebrowser
   touch /home/filebrowser/filebrowser.db
   touch /home/filebrowser/.filebrowser.json
   ```

   These commands create a directory for File Browser and two files: one for the database and another for the configuration.

2. **Edit the Configuration File**

   Open the configuration file with a text editor (e.g., nano):

   ```bash
   sudo nano /home/filebrowser/.filebrowser.json
   ```

   Insert the following JSON configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "port": 80,
     "noAuth": false,
     "baseURL": "",
     "address": "",
     "log": "stdout",
     "database": "/database.db",
     "root": "/srv"
   }
   ```

   Save the file and exit the editor.

3. **Set File Permissions**

   Adjust permissions for the database file to ensure File Browser can access it:

   ```bash
   chmod 666 /home/filebrowser/filebrowser.db
   ```

4. **Run File Browser in Docker**

   Start the File Browser container in detached mode:

   ```bash
   sudo docker run -d \
       -v /home/filebrowser:/srv \
       -v /home/filebrowser/filebrowser.db:/database.db \
       -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
       -p 8080:80 \
       --restart unless-stopped \
       filebrowser/filebrowser
   ```
## Setting file perms CAREFULL

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 /home/filebrowser
```
   This command will start File Browser in the background and map it to port 8080 on your host machine.

## Accessing File Browser

After running the Docker command, File Browser will be accessible through your web browser:

- URL: `http://localhost:8080`
- Default Username: `admin`
- Default Password: `admin`

Remember to change the default username and password for security reasons.

## Management Commands

- **View Logs**: `docker logs [container-id]`
- **Stop Container**: `docker stop [container-id]`
- **Start Container**: `docker start [container-id]`

Find your container ID using `docker ps`.
