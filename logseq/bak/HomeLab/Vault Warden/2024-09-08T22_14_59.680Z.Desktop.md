# Documentation: Setting Up a Vaultwarden Server for Two-Factor Authentication

## Introduction
This guide explains how to set up a Vaultwarden server for handling two-factor authentication (2FA) codes as an alternative to Authy. Vaultwarden is a lightweight, self-hosted Bitwarden server alternative. Additionally, it includes steps to secure the server with HTTPS using Cloudflare and Nginx.

## Prerequisites
- A server with Docker installed.
- A domain managed with Cloudflare.
- Nginx for reverse proxy setup.
- Basic understanding of Docker, Nginx, and SSL.

## Steps to Set Up Vaultwarden

### 1. Installing Docker and Docker Compose
- Install Docker:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install docker
  ```
- Install Docker Compose:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install docker-compose
  ```

### 2. Pulling the Vaultwarden Docker Image
- Pull the latest Vaultwarden server image:
  ```bash
  sudo docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
  ```

### 3. Setting Up the Vaultwarden Directory
- Create a directory for Vaultwarden data:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir /srv/vaultwarden
  ```
- Set appropriate permissions:
  ```bash
  sudo chmod go-rwx /srv/vaultwarden
  ```

### 4. Running the Vaultwarden Container
- Start the Vaultwarden Docker container:
  ```bash
  sudo docker run -d --name vaultwarden -v /srv/vaultwarden:/data -e WEBSOCKET_ENABLED=true -p 8080:80 -p 3012:3012 --restart unless-stopped vaultwarden/server:latest
  ```

### 5. Accessing Vaultwarden
- Access the Vaultwarden server by navigating to `http://[your-server-ip]:8080` (e.g., `172.16.16.70:8080`).

### 6. Configuring HTTPS with Cloudflare and Nginx
- **DNS Configuration in Cloudflare**:
  - Create a new CNAME record pointing to your domain (e.g., `bitwarden.example.net` CNAME `example.net`).
- **Setting Up Nginx Reverse Proxy**:
  - Go to your Nginx configuration and set up a new proxy for Vaultwarden:
    - Proxy Name: `bitwarden.example.net`
    - Proxy Pass URL: `http://172.16.16.70:8080` (replace with your Vaultwarden server IP and port).
    - Block common exploits.
- **SSL Configuration**:
  - In the SSL tab, set SSL to DNS wildcard (e.g., `*.example.com`).
  - Enable the option to force SSL.

### 7. Finalizing Setup
- After setting up the proxy and SSL, visit `https://bitwarden.example.net` to access your secured Vaultwarden server.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you have successfully set up a Vaultwarden server for managing 2FA codes, providing an alternative to Authy. The server is accessible via a secure connection through Nginx and Cloudflare, ensuring data safety and privacy. Regularly check for updates to Vaultwarden, Docker, and Nginx to maintain security and performance.
