	- (Discretionary Access Control):**
	- Access is determined by the owner of the resource, who can grant permissions to others. This is not the primary mechanism used by SELinux.
- ### RBAC #card
  background-color:: red
	- (Role-Based Access Control):**
	- Access is based on the roles assigned to users. Although SELinux can incorporate aspects of role-based policies, its core mechanism is MAC.
- ### MAC #card
  background-color:: pink
	- (Mandatory Access Control):
	- SELinux enforces security policies that dictate how processes and users can access system resources, regardless of the userâ€™s discretion. This is the primary security mechanism imposed by SELinux.
- ### ABAC #card
  background-color:: green
	- (Attribute-Based Access Control):**
	- Access decisions are based on attributes (such as user attributes, resource attributes, etc.). This is not the mechanism used by SELinux.
- ### SRTP #card
  background-color:: green
	- **SRTP** is specifically designed to provide encryption, authentication, and integrity for real-time multimedia communications, such as audio and video streams over IP networks. It is an extension of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) that secures the data being transmitted.
- ### FRR #card
  background-color:: red
	- False Rejection Rate
	- which is a metric used to measure the likelihood that a bio metric security system is called incorrectly
- ### PAM #card
  background-color:: green
	- Privileged access management
- ### ISO #card
  background-color:: purple
	- International organization for standardization
