	- ### Preventative
	  background-color:: yellow
		- Technical Controls
			- Operating systems
			- Firewalls
			- Antivirus
			- Managerial Controls
				- Administrative controls with security design and implementation, these are telling your employees how to use a device securely and helping enforce that.
				- Day to Day aka procedural
			- Operational Controls
				- Controls implemented by people
				- example: Security Guards, awareness programs
			- Physical Controls
